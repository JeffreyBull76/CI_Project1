# Aghamore Tidy Village

The site is for a community group of volunteers and the organisation which helps keep their village tidy. 

Aghamore is a village in Mayo in the west of Ireland, and as with many rural village it is often overlooked by larger government bodies. <br/>The Aghamore tidy village group seeks to rectify this by keeping the village, clean, tidy and well kept. <br/>This site hopes to give a brief overview of the above, provide a gallery and a contact page for people to leave feedback.

The aim was to achieve a simple, retro styled yet modern website that was fully responsive whilst using no Javascript. Only pure HTML and CSS were used.<br/>Further to this the desire was to have slightly different layouts at various sizes in attempt to convey the same feeling regardless how it was viewed.

## Features

* ## Page Header

   * On screen sizes above 820px in width consists of 3 buttons floated right with a simple animation when hovered. These show active page with an underline when clicked.
   * All elements are responsive at various sizes
   * The bunting (flags) effect is desinged to be asymmetrical, it shifts and scales at various screen sizes to remain in view but not to obscure anything vital.
   * Bunting was designed using inkscape by me.

* ## Hero Image / Landing section

   * Image of Aghamores main street with welcome button.
   * Welcome button auto navigates to the text content below (mainly for use on mobiles)
   * This image is wide and expansive and not suited to harsh scaling. As such css that increases the size of the image without effecting the contained is used to convery the same feel at various sizes.
   * Image created in gimp from photo taken by me and then optimised with [tingpng.com](http://tinypng.com)
