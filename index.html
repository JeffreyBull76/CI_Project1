                Aghamore or Achadh Mór in Gaelic ( meaning "big field" ) situated in County Mayo is in the heart
                of the West of Ireland. A beautiful peaceful village Achadh Mor is only 10 minutes from Ireland
                West Airport Knock and approx 1 hour from Galway, Sligo.Aghamore village is set within the
                wider Aghamore Townland which lies just Northwest of the town of Ballyhaunis stretching to the
                N17 on its eastern border.

                It is a very traditional Irish village with a church, post office, school and 2 pubs. Although its
                Gaelic name means "big field" suggesting a flatness to the area, Aghamore is hilly and
                picturesque, offering lovely views over to the Nephin mountain range and Croagh Patrick in the
                west and the Ox Mountains to the North.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find all kinds of beautiful flora and fauna in this peaceful and idyllic part of West Ireland.

            <p>We are a group of enthusiastic volunteers who care about our little village. 
                Our aim is to maintain and improve our surrounds for the good of residents and visitors alike.</p>
            <p>Regular tasks include litter picking, tidying and mowing, and we are responsible for the lovely
                pots, barrels and baskets filled with seasonal colour dotted all around the village.</p>

            <p>A recent ongoing project is landscaping Newls Corner near the N17, after construction to widen
                the road resulted in removal of an old hedgerow. We are replanting native meadow and wild
                shrubs up the bank to complement the surrounding countryside.</p>
            <p>
                Another project was commissioning a local artist to paint a mural onto the front of an old and
                derelict shop, making it a cheery focal point and a reminder of it's use in times gone by.

                We recently held a Vintage Work Day in the grounds of the Community Centre which raised
                money for upcoming Tidy Village projects as well as a local children's hospice charity. We had
                people come from far and wide to show off their vintage tractors, farming machinery and even a
                steam engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                A charity tractor run set off from the GAA pitch and ran from Aghamore to London
                and back, a month long journey and incredible feat, fair play to all of the drivers!
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="icon_doodads">

            <p>
                We held a
                ploughing contest in an adjacent field and had two magnificent draught horses show us all how
                it was done in the not so distant past. There was a traditional blacksmith, vintage cars to lovingly
                gawp at and a burger van to fill up on after all the hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to our volunteers everyone was kept happy with tea, coffee and cake and we even had
                a visit from a pet sheep who merrily wandered around the community centre running track.
                Happy Days!
